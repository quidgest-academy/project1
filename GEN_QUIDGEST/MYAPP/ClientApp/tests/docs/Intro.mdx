<h1>Genio Proto</h1>
<p>
	Genio Proto is a component preview gallery that lets you explore and test all the components
	available in Genio generated Vuejs UI.
</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>
	Components are atomic pieces of a UI, usually with a very narrow function, that can be grouped
	and composed into more complex interfaces. A component can be configured though its properties
	(props) do alter its display and behaviour in some cases. As the user interactes with this piece
	of interface the component will then emit events that will allow parent components to handle it
	as they wish. Components are as much business agnostic as possible so that they are reusable
	multiple times in the same application.
</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
This gallery is organized around stories. A story is the visualization of a component in a certain state.
Each component is demonstrated through several stories that represent common states of that control in
the application, and allow you to quickly browse between them to understand the component's main funcions.
Stories are fully user interactive. Each story also allows a number of component properties to be changed
to visualize how the component reacts to that change.

<h2>Categories</h2>
The list of components is grouped into several categories that represent similar component functions:

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Containers</b>: Contain several other components inside them, to create a notion of
		sections in the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Inputs</b>: They display and edit a single value of data.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Static</b>: Don't manipulate data directly but provide static displays of information or
		allow enable user interaction.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Views</b>: Display lists of structured data in different visualizations.
	</li>
</ul>
